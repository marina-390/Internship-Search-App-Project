| `position_categories` | Many-to-many: positions ↔ categories |
| `student_categories` | Many-to-many: students ↔ categories |
| `applications` | Student applications for positions |
| `favorites` | Student saved positions (FK → Users.user_id) |

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A [Supabase](https://supabase.com) project with the schema above
- [Vercel](https://vercel.com) account (or any static hosting)
- A modern browser

### Local setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/marina-390/Internship-Search-App-Project.git
cd Internship-Search-App-Project

# Create your Supabase config file
cp js/supabase.example.js js/supabase.js
# Open js/supabase.js and fill in your Supabase URL and anon key

# Serve locally (any static server works)
# Option 1 — VS Code Live Server extension (recommended)
# Option 2 — Python
python -m http.server 5500
# Option 3 — Node
npx serve .
```

Open `http://localhost:5500` in your browser.

### Supabase credentials

`js/supabase.js` is excluded from version control (`.gitignore`).  
Copy the template and add your own keys:

```js
// js/supabase.js
const SUPABASE_URL      = 'https://your-project-id.supabase.co';
const SUPABASE_ANON_KEY = 'your-anon-key-here';
const supabaseClient    = supabase.createClient(SUPABASE_URL, SUPABASE_ANON_KEY);
```

> **Never use the `service_role` key on the client side.** The anon key is safe to use in browser code — data access is controlled by RLS policies.

### Deploy to Vercel

1. Push to GitHub
2. Import the repository in Vercel
3. No build step required — it's a static site
4. Vercel serves `index.html` as the root

---

## Demo Recording Script

`demo_script.py` automates a full walkthrough of the app and records two video files that are merged into one.

### Requirements

```bash
pip install playwright
playwright install chromium
# ffmpeg must be installed for auto-merge
winget install ffmpeg        # Windows
brew install ffmpeg          # macOS
```

### Run

```bash
python demo_script.py
```

**What it records:**

| Part | Steps |
|------|-------|
| 1 | Home page → language switch (EN → FI) → registration |
| 2 | Login → profile edit → browse internships → mark favorites → apply → resume builder |

Part 1 pauses for email confirmation. After confirming, press **Enter** in the terminal to continue.  
The two clips are merged automatically into `demo_video/demo_final.webm`.

---

## Localization

Three languages are supported: **English**, **Finnish**, **Swedish**.

All translatable strings live in `js/i18n.js` inside the `TRANSLATIONS` object.  
The active language is stored in `localStorage` under the key `lang` and applied by `applyTranslations()` on every page load.

To add a new language:
1. Add a new top-level key to `TRANSLATIONS` in `i18n.js`
2. Add a button in the language dropdown in every HTML file
